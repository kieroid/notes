Primitive data types are data types which are built into the Java language and not derived from classes.

There are 8 primitive data types in Java.
1. Byte
   A byte can only hold a limited number of data.
2. Short
3. Int
4. Long
5. Float
6. Double
7. Boolean
8. Char


Two `char` standards exist:
- Unicode
- ANSII

Java uses Unicode, which the characters are stored as numbers. The unicode character set can consist of 65535 ($2^{16}$) individual characters. With Unicode, a single character is held in 2 bytes of memory unlike ASCII's 1

Commenting code:
- Single line comment (`//`)
- Multi-line comment (`/* ... */`)
