* The software process
A software process is a set of related activities that leads to the production of a software system.

Many different processes but all involve these 4 SE activities:
- Specification (what should the system do?)
- Design and implementation (how is it design/implemented?)
- Validation (what does the customer want?)
- Evolution (how can it be updated for the changing customer needs?)

A software process model is an abstract representation of a process. It presents a description of a process from a particular perspective.

In this chapter, we are going to go over how these 4 specifications can be defined beforehand.

** Plan-driven and agile processed
- Plan-driven processes are processes where all the process activities are planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan.
- In agile processes, planning is incremental and easier to change the process.
