* Rapid Software Development
Rapid development and delivery is now often the most important requirement for software systems.
- Businesses operate in a fast, changing requirements and it is practically impossible to produce a set of stable software requirements.
- Software has to evolve quickly to reflect changing business needs.

Plan-driven development is essential for some types of system, but does not meet these business needs.

Agile development methods emerged in the late 1990's whose aim was to radically reduce the delivery time for working software systems.

Principles of agile methods:
- Customer involvment
- Incremental delivery
- People, not process
- Embrace change
- Maintain simplicity
