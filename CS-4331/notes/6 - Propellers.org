* Propellers
Propellers (size, pitch, design..) impact the aircrafts flight.
- Power, grip, efficency, speed, manuverability, and durability are attributes of propellers.
- Propellers (especially quadcopter) have to have two propellers that are mirror images of each other.


** Propeller Nomenclature
- L - Length
- P - Pitch
- B - number of Blades

Propeller size is directly linked to thrust, responsiveness, and the amount of "grip" the multirotor will have in the air.
- Smaller propellers will respond faster to inputs because they are sweeping through less air and require less power to change speed.

Camber is the assemetry between the two acting surfaces of an airfoil.

$\text{Pitch Speed [m/s]} = \text{RPM}\times \text{Pitch [inches]}$
